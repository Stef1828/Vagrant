= Vagrant

* Vagrant abstracts virtualization
* We are used to provision VMs through the GUI
* Vagrant codifies the provisioning process
** Using the API's the *providers* like VirtualBox or VMWare exposes
** Once the VM is created, it has to be *provisioned*
** The specification for the VMs is written in a Vagrantfile

== Getting used to the software
=== Step 0

* Install VirtualBox
* Install Vagrant

=== Step 1
* Prepare your first **virtual environment**. 

  mkdir vagrant
  cd vagrant
  mkdir debian11
  cd debian11
  vagrant init debian/bullseye64
  
* Read the automatically created *Vagrantfile* and make sure you understand the configuration settings. 

* Start the virtual environment and read the logs on your screen.

  vagrant up

* Use SSH to "Log in" to the virtual environment. The default user and password is "vagrant" and "vagrant".

  vagrant ssh

* Become the user *root* by using the command *sudo su*

  sudo su -
  
* Update and upgrade the Linux system. Only then install and run the software *htop*

  Google is your friend :-)

* Exit and halt the virtual environment

  exit
  vagrant halt
  
* Remove the virtual envoronment

  vagrant destroy
